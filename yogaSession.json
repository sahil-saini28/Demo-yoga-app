The disorders and diseases related to Diabetes, Hypertension, digestive, metabolic, respiratory, gynaecological, neuro-muscular skeletal, spinal, spondylitis, back pains, knee pains, joint pains, thyroid, excretory related, kidney, migraine, insomnia, &nbsp;stress, eye sight improvement, stamina, Adrenal balancing, Anger, Concentration, Ego and Greed, I.Q. etc are managed through the by-product benefit of the tradition knowledge of Yoga and other alternative means of Healing. This session needs patience and surrender to let the healing flow.</p>\\n<p>Dynamic Yoga<br>Strong, dynamic workshop style class with arm balances, inversions, backbends &amp; twists. Be prepared to keep a brisk pace and explore poses we don&rsquo;t normally get to experience in a general class. Dynamic sequencing combines breath and movement to build strength, flexibility, endurance, concentration and compassionate approach to flow with the breath through sun salutations, standing, sitting, supine, prone and inverted postures. Centre progressively allows newer and more advanced participants the opportunity to go deeper to relax, honouring the body as needed. This is a great session to work on extra fats and weight management. Everyone is welcome.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Children Yoga</p>\\n<p>Introducing children to yoga helps them learn healthy lifestyle habits and set the foundation for a responsible and happy future. We use chanting, balancing, memory games, moral role plays and gazing practices to improve their memory, concentration and focus. We motivate them to express their aptitude, skills and raise their self-worth as well as boost their confidence. Through dramatization and role play kids express their emotions better. Relaxed learning deepens the perception, reducing distractions and increasing attention span. This activates the dormant areas of the brain. Children are born yogis, lets preserve their yoginnocence.</p>\\n<p>Sukshma Yoga</p>\\n<p>A practice that uses slow movement, props and longer holds to stimulate and release body toxins. The nature of this practice is meditative, asking us to slow down, turn in and shift from doing to being.&nbsp;This session is the session meant for longevity, purification and release of all the unwanted stress. This opens up the blocked pathways inside our body and joints. It&rsquo;s a releasing factor to our suppressed subtle energies. This practice is applicable to everyone from childhood, adulthood, motherhood, fatherhood, parenthood, homemakers/ housewives, grand parenthood. This clears out the extras so that we naturally be the best of ourselves.</p>\\n<p>Pratyahara</p>\\n<p>A bridge that has a strong connectivity of two destinations is pratyahara, these innovative sessions are made to make one reach the potential destination through the applied knowledge of our scriptures. Internal journeys through each of the &lsquo;dwara&rsquo; and de-knotting the knots or &lsquo;granthis&rsquo; inside is the key essence of this session. This session induces towards dharana, dhyana and samadhi if perceived with utmost sincerity and reverence.</p>\"}]",

It was then after a few years of dedicated practice that I thought this yoga knowledge should not be limited to myself. I had seen miracles happening in my daily yoga class, with people recovering from ailments, these were people whose story I knew personally. This happened over time though, neither in a day, nor in a week. All I knew for myself was, I would smile with peace in my heart after the class and at the very thought of yoga practice any time during the day!\"",

This change is due to my personal history as a teacher and as a student: after having thought and practiced follwing this traditional methods, I have got to know their limits (in a physical sense through injuries,in a mental sense through the inabilty to really come to my needs). &nbsp;Therefore these classes will quite likely move away from what you might have experienced in other yoga classes, as we come into a more free and empathetic way to work with the body. I will combine somatic movements, restorative poses and the practice will be &nbsp;structured on the base of my background studies in the field of psychology and yoga massage. This will ensure that your practice won't be structured in a rigid way, but you will be &nbsp;really coming closer to yourself,your body and its needs. You will be able to freely move &nbsp;in a safe and mindful way. A general structure will include the warming up of the joints, gentle and more complex movements where we will be able to reach poses grounding into them, and finding movements again into that stillness. Keeping your mind alert on what's happening inside, you will be asked to experience and feel how every asana and transition affects your body and what you should avoid doing, acknowledging so, the unique features of your body.<br>More focus and self-awareness, an increased level on physical and mental energy, a &nbsp;state of self confidence and trust and a feeling of balance and overall strength will be experienced and will guide you through the rest of the day.<br>&nbsp;</p>\"}]",

This has helped me really understand what pregnancy means to a woman and  how yoga can help her embrace the physiological, psychological and emotional changes in her.  I am grateful for the prenatal journey I could embark on during my pregnancy and I think no woman should miss out on experiencing this.  This is what motivates me to teach Prenatal Yoga.",
