Many amongst them were from Mumbai. As their number grew, they requested Swamiji to open the branch of the institute in Mumbai itself. In response to these requests the Mumbai branch of the Kaivalyadhama was started on the 6th January, 1932, in the suburbs of Mumbai. Later on, for a greater convenience of the people, the Health Centre was shifted from the suburb to its present site on Marine Drive. A substantial donation from Sir Chunilal Mehta, made it possible for the Health Centre to have its own building. In the memory of Sir Mehta’s son, it was renamed as Ishwardas Chunilal Yogic Health Centre, Kaivalyadhama and was inaugurated as a full-fledge centre on 30th April, 1932.",

In addition to the physical practice, I also teach spiritual aspects of yoga so that there is an impact on the body as well as the mind.\n\nMy aim is for students to absorb my calm energy and leave the class with a peaceful feeling.\n\nI have worked with both individuals and groups comprising of students of all ages in India & Sri Lanka.\n\nI’m from Varanasi but my heart belongs to the whole world.",

          "description": "Yoga is the relationship that is built between the body, the mind and the breath. Yoga is creating space free from obstacles in your own body to live. Yoga is freedom and release. I am here to help others find this release so that they can comfortable and competently move their bodies through life.” and While I have many skills that help me be an effective teacher , I believe some most valuable skills are being patient and having strong communication skills. These skills help me guide students gently and ensure everyone remains comfortable throughout each lesson.\"\nAs I am a certified Naturopath and yoga doctor, so I incorporates the knowledge of naturopathic principles in my teaching style and help to get extra benefits of yoga through diet and lifestyle management.",
